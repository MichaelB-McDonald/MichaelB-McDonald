                Bamboo Forest, Arashiyama Bamboo Grove or Sagano Bamboo Forest, is a natural forest of bamboo in Arashiyama, Kyoto, Japan. The forest consists mostly of Moso Bamboo (Phyllostachys edulis) and consists of several pathways for tourists and visitors. The Ministry of the Environment considers it a part of the soundscape of Japan.[1]

                Prior to 2015 there was a charge to access the forest

                The forest is not far from Tenryū-ji Temple, which is the location of Rinzai School, and the famous Nonomiya Shrine.[1]

                    Rivers of Japan are characterized by their relatively short lengths and considerably steep gradients due to the narrow and mountainous topography of the country. An often-cited quote is 'this is not a river, but a waterfall' by the Dutch engineer (o-yatoi gaikokujin) Johannis de Rijke who had visited the Jōganji River, Toyama Prefecture. The Mogami, the Fuji and the Kuma are regarded as the three most rapid rivers of Japan.

                    Typical rivers of Japan rise from mountainous forests and cut out deep V-shaped valleys in their upper reaches, and form alluvial plains in their lower reaches which enable the Japanese to cultivate rice fields and to set up cities. Most rivers are dammed to supply both water and electricity.

                  The Tottori Sand Dunes (鳥取砂丘, Tottori sakyū) are sand dunes located outside the city center of Tottori in Tottori Prefecture, Japan. At a length of 9 miles (14 km) and less than 1.5 miles (2.4 km) wide, it is the largest sand dune in Japan. The sand dunes are part of San'in Kaigan Geopark, which is part of The UNESCO Global Geoparks.
                  <img src="Images/desert.jpg" width="35%" class="float-end m-2">
                  The sand formations were created when sediment deposits carried from the Chūgoku Mountains by the Sendai River were thrown away into the Sea of Japan. Strong winds then shaped the dunes over a span of 100,000 years.
                  The area of the dunes has been steadily decreasing due to a government reforestation program following World War II. Concrete barriers have been built along the coast to prevent the formations from eroding. Authorities have adopted measures to stop the shrinkage of the dunes, partly because they attract a significant amount of tourism to the area.

            The region experiences unpredictable weather with a rather cool climate and bright sunlight. In this region the summers are short, hot, and mostly cloudy. The winters are very cold, windy, and partly cloudy. It is also wet year-round.
            Over the course of the year, the temperature typically ranges from 32°F to 89°F. The Summers last for approximately 2 months, from June 23 to September 17, with an average daily high temperature above 80°F. The winters last for approximately 3 months, from December 3 to March 18, with an average daily high temperature below 53°F.

                Class A river system (一級水系, Ikkyū suikei) is a designation applied to rivers and waterways deemed to be important to the economy of the nation as a whole, as well as those deemed important to the conservation of nature within Japan. There are currently 109 rivers with this designation.
