                Historically, Japanese folk music was strongly influenced by music from China, with some of its forms being imported from China more than a thousand years ago. Many popular Japanese musical instruments originated in China and were then adapted to meet local needs.
                Traditional Japanese music usually refers to Japan’s historical folk music. Two forms are recognised as the oldest forms  - shōmyō, or Buddhist chanting, and gagaku, or theatrical court music.

            Shōmyō is a ritual music sung in a Buddhist ceremony by a group of Buddhist monks – literally translated, the word ‘shōmyō’ combines the characters for ‘voice’ and ‘wisdom’.

            Gagaku is the oldest of Japan's musical traditions and includes dances and songs in two styles – kigaku, which is instrumental music, and seigaku, a form of vocal music.

                Japan has been subject to sudden invasions of new ideas followed by long periods of minimal contact with the outside world. Over time the Japanese developed the ability to absorb, imitate, and finally assimilate those elements of foreign culture that complemented their aesthetic preferences.

                The origins of Japanese dance can be traced to ancient imperial court music called gagaku, which dates to the Heian period (794-1192). Gagaku is a highly distinctive genre of music, song, and dance that evolved as a fusion of native Japanese songs and dances and Buddhist performing arts from China and the Korean Peninsula. Even today it continues to be performed during imperial ceremonies.
                <img src="Images/dance1.jpg" width="35%" class="float-end m-2">
                A new type of song-and-dance performance called shirabyoshi appeared in the twelfth century, featuring women dressed as men singing hit songs of the day and dancing to the accompaniment of flutes and drums. In the fourteenth century a masked dance-drama called noh was born, featuring performances by actors who danced mai as they narrated a story. And in the seventeenth century, a woman named Okuni of Izumo founded a troupe of actresses and put on dance and drama performances in Kyoto, which won widespread popularity. From these performances, kabuki evolved into a genre of its own in the Edo period (1603-1868), and there developed a type of dance performed during kabuki plays.

            There are several Japanese dramatic forms in which music plays a significant role. The main ones are kabuki and noh. Kabuki is known for its highly stylised dancing and singing, together with its elaborate make-up (sported by a predominantly male cast).

                The earliest complex art in Japan was produced in the 7th and 8th centuries in connection with Buddhism. In the 9th century, as the Japanese began to turn away from China and develop indigenous forms of expression, the secular arts became increasingly important; until the late 15th century, both religious and secular arts flourished. 
                After the Ōnin War (1467–1477), Japan entered a period of political, social, and economic disruption that lasted for over a century. In the state that emerged under the leadership of the Tokugawa shogunate, organized religion played a much less important role in people's lives, and the arts that survived were primarily secular. The Meiji Period (1868-1912) saw an abrupt influx of Western styles, which have continued to be important.

        <div class="history bg-info"><h4>DANCE</h4></div>

                Dance has a long history in Japan and encompasses many forms. The dances performed in kabuki plays are called Nihon buyo (Japanese dance) and are widely enjoyed not just by professional actors but by ordinary people, who learn them as a hobby.


                There are two types of movements in Japanese dance. One comes from mai, which has its roots in noh drama, and the second comes from odori, which originated in kabuki. In mai relatively simple movements, such as a slow shuffle and a quickly paced circling of the stage, are combined and repeated. The beauty of ancient dances, which were dedicated to the gods, can still be seen in mai. Odori, by contrast, has many showy, boisterous movements, such as leg lifts, turns, and a variety of other steps.

                  Kimono are an indispensable element of Japanese dance, and the shamisen, a three-stringed musical instrument, is most commonly used as an accompaniment. Shamisen music is combined with chants or narration to create a scene or story, and costumes and choreography give form to the moods of the characters. Some pieces are pure dances separate from the story, spirited performances to rhythmical music put on by a large number of performers.
                  The origins of Japanese dance can be traced to ancient imperial court music called gagaku, which dates to the Heian period (794-1192). Gagaku is a highly distinctive genre of music, song, and dance that evolved as a fusion of native Japanese songs and dances and Buddhist performing arts from China and the Korean Peninsula. Even today it continues to be performed during imperial ceremonies.
