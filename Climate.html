                Japan’s weather and climate features four distinct seasons, something which the local Japanese seem to be quite proud of. Depending on the experience you’re after, each season offers its own unique conditions and attractions however, the best time to visit Japan is generally spring or autumn when the weather is fine and mild.

                Spring from March to May is perhaps one of the very best times to visit Japan as temperatures are pleasantly warm without being too hot, with daytime temperatures ranging between 21C to 26C. The weather is fine with little rain and from March to April, the landscape is awash with colour as the famous Cherry Blossoms bloom and festivals are celebrated.

                    Japan has 4 distinct seasons starting with a cold and dry winter. The welcome spring is mild and brings out Japan’s famous cherry blossoms. The summer starts with the rainy season in late June or early July, followed by heat and humidity through August. The arrival of autumn is marked by typhoons and heavy rain in September. The colorful fall leaves are spectacular and draw crowds of tourists. The far north and south naturally experience the extremes of hot and cold, making Hokkaido good for skiing in winter and Okinawa a popular seaside destination during the warmer months.

                    Japan predominantly occupies the temperate zone, and Japanese people take great pleasure in the transition of the four distinct seasons. The emphasis on seasonality that permeates every aspect of Japanese culture can be traced to its nature-based Shinto religion and agrarian past.

            Summer from June to August begins with heavy rainfall which turns the country into a steam bath with temperatures as high as 35C and extreme humidity. If you plan on visiting Japan during the summer weather, northern areas such as Hokkaido or the mountains of Tohoku or Chubu are the most comfortable places to escape the heat. The best thing about summer however is the fantastic firework shows and festivals.

            Autumn from September to November is also a wonderful time to visit Japan with the weather much more tolerable than in summer. The days are commonly fair and the landscape turns to rich autumn shades which are almost as impressive as the stunning cherry blossoms. However, visitors to Japan in autumn should be aware that this is also typhoon season in parts of southern Japan which can bring things to a standstill so plan accordingly.

                  Japan has a mainly temperate climate, ranging from cold in the north to subtropical in the south. The climate varies from humid continental (Köppen climate classification Dfb) in the north to tropical rainforest and tropical monsoon in the south (Köppen Af, Am). Most regions in central and southern Japan experience a humid subtropical climate (Köppen Cfa).

                  The mountains in the central highlands display an alpine climate (Köppen ET) at high altitudes. Japan is an island country in East Asia along the Pacific Coast, with a northeast-southwest orientation. The Russian Far East lies across the Sea of Okhotsk in the north, the Pacific Ocean is in the east, China and Taiwan are across the East China Sea in the southwest, and the Korean Peninsula is in the west across the Sea of Japan. The latitudes, proximity to vast bodies of water, high mountain ranges, and ocean currents influence the climate.

            Winter from December to February is a magical time to visit as the landscape is turned white with snow. It’s the perfect time to go skiing or check out the hot springs however visitors should be aware that it does get very cold and some areas can receive quite heavy snow or freezing wind blasts from Siberia. Okinawa is a great place to visit during the winter as it is not quite as cold as the rest of Japan’s weather. Temperatures in winter generally range from -4C up to 21C in some warmer parts.

The emphasis on seasonality that permeates every aspect of Japanese culture can be traced to its nature-based Shinto religion and agrarian past. Besides enjoying seasonal recreation and events during a year in Japan, also pay attention to the concept of “shun” (旬), which celebrates seasonal food such as fish, fruits, and vegetables, at the peak of its deliciousness.

                  Japan is an archipelago of volcanic islands 20°N to 45°N of the equator. The country has a long coastline of 18,486 miles along with numerous outlying islands. The rugged terrain comprises 73% mountainous regions, and 66% of the total area consists of forests. Hokkaido, Honshu, Kyushu, Shikoku, and Okinawa are the 5 major islands. Each main island has a mountain range. The Hida, Kiso, and Akaishi mountain chains converge in central Japan. The Kanto, Nobi, and Osaka are the three largest plains in central Honshu. Numerous hot springs dot the country. Rivers are deep and swift. The Shinano River is the longest river with a length of 228 miles. The tallest peak in Japan at the height of 3776 meters is Mount Fuji, a dormant volcano. Lake Hachirogata is the lowest point at 4 meters below sea level. No point in Japan lies more than 93 miles from the sea. Eight warm and cold ocean currents surround the Japanese archipelago.
